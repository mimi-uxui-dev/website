                         Hi, I'm Taous Khoudour! I also go by Mimi. <br /><br />



                         People are what I care about and how to make there life better, since our time on this planet is limited,
                         choosing a job that improves people's lives and enables me to find solutions to there problems is the noblest job to do and this is I want to have a career. <br /><br />

                         I'm a self-taught designer & developer, I've read plenty of books and blogs about UX design and user research, learned about concepts,
                         principles, theories, and processes of product design & UI, I applied all that knowledge in projects and in freelancerâ€™s. <br /><br />

                         I'm hopefull to put my skills to use. I am goal-orientend, self-motivated, dependable,
                         empathatecic, great listener and communicator, and an ultracareful problem solver. <br /><br />

                         With everything I do, I intend to provide people with amazing experiences & take businesses and Product Design to the next level, towards the future.
